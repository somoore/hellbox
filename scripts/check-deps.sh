#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Supply-chain pin/hash gate across every dependency ecosystem in the repo.
# FAILS on any dependency that is not pinned to a specific release with integrity
# (hash) verification. WARNS on documented dev-only soft-pins. Run by pre-commit
# and CI; safe to run anywhere (read-only, no network).
#
# Ecosystems here:
#   - Rust   : Cargo.lock pins exact versions + checksums for every crate; deny.toml
#              [sources] rejects unknown registries/git deps. cargo-deny enforces.
#   - Python : capsule/requirements.txt uses pip --require-hashes (checked deeply by
#              scripts/check-reqs.sh; here we assert the mode is on).
#   - JS     : the only JS dep (playwright) is pulled by a dev-only `npm exec
#              --package playwright@<pinned>` helper. Version-pinned, not hash-locked,
#              not shipped — flagged as an accepted soft-pin, not a hard failure.
