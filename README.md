# LambdaDoom

### DOOM, running inside an AWS Lambda MicroVM, streamed to your browser.

Suspend it mid firefight and the compute bill stops. Resume it and you are back on the exact
frame, same demon mid lunge, same health, same ammo.

```bash
ldoom open   # a browser tab opens. it's DOOM. it's running in the cloud.
```

LambdaDoom runs the original DOOM on a virtual machine in AWS and streams the video, audio,
and your keypresses to a browser tab. Nothing runs on your laptop but the tab. It deploys into
your own AWS account with one command, and one command removes it.

## What is an AWS Lambda MicroVM?

A new serverless building block that runs your code inside a full virtual machine: real VM
isolation, near instant launch, and the ability to freeze a running machine and resume it
later with its state intact, all with no servers to manage. It is powered by Firecracker, the
same virtualization behind AWS Lambda. AWS launched it in June 2026:
[the announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/run-isolated-sandboxes-with-full-lifecycle-control-aws-lambda-introduces-microvms/).

The piece that makes LambdaDoom work is suspend and resume. AWS snapshots the live memory of
the VM, stops charging for compute, and restores it on demand. Freezing a live DOOM fight is
the most direct way I found to feel what that primitive actually does.

## Quickstart

You need the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with credentials. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somoore/LambdaDoom
cd LambdaDoom
./deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` deploys the AWS prerequisites, downloads the prebuilt `ldoom` CLI for your system,
builds the MicroVM image, launches it, and opens DOOM in your browser. In the tab: click the
speaker icon for sound, click the game, and play (`W A S D` to move, `Ctrl` to fire, `Space`
to open doors). Hit Suspend when you step away to stop the compute bill, and Resume to pick up
where you left off.

> **Cost:** a suspended VM is roughly cents per month, and a running, streamed session is
> roughly $0.19 per hour. Suspend when you walk away, or run `./uninstall.sh` to remove
> everything (the VM, the image, the stack, and all local state).

## How it works

```

+--------------------------+            +--------------------------------------+
|  ldoom (Rust CLI)        |  SigV4/SDK |  Lambda MicroVMs control plane        |
|  build up open suspend.. |----------->|  create-image . run . token . suspend |
|  loopback proxy          |  injects X-aws-proxy-auth header
|  127.0.0.1:6080  --------+---- WSS --->  <id>.lambda-microvm.<region>.on.aws
|  browser tab             |            |  MicroVM (ARM64 Firecracker)          |
+--------------------------+            |   Chocolate Doom -> H.264 + Opus      |
                                        +--------------------------------------+
```

A small Rust CLI (`ldoom`) drives the lifecycle. Inside the VM, native ARM Chocolate Doom
renders into a headless X server; an encoder streams it as H.264 with Opus audio over
WebSockets, and the browser decodes it with WebCodecs. The MicroVM endpoint needs an auth
header that browsers cannot set, so `ldoom open` runs a tiny loopback proxy that injects it.

Full design is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), the security model is in
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md), and the verified MicroVMs API facts are in
[docs/microvm-ground-truth.md](docs/microvm-ground-truth.md).

<summary><b>Run it yourself</b> (without <code>deploy.sh</code>)</summary>

`./deploy.sh` in the Quickstart above is the easy path: it creates the stack, downloads the
`ldoom` binary, builds the image, launches it, and opens the tab. Do the steps below only if
you would rather drive each piece by hand.

**1. Create the prerequisite stack** (an S3 build bucket and two IAM roles). Either click
Launch Stack:

[![Launch Stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://lambdadoom-launch-932930471665.s3.amazonaws.com/doom.yaml&stackName=LambdaDoom)

or run the CLI:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --region us-east-1 --stack-name LambdaDoom \
  --template-file deploy/doom.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

**2. Get the `ldoom` binary.** Download the one for your system from
[Releases](https://github.com/somoore/LambdaDoom/releases), or build from source:
`cd rs-cli && make release`.

**3. Write `~/.lambdadoom/config.toml`** from the stack outputs (region, artifact bucket, and
the build and execution role ARNs).

**4. Drive the lifecycle:**

```bash
ldoom build      # zip capsule -> S3 -> build image (compiles engine, fetches WAD) -> CREATED
ldoom up         # launch a MicroVM from the image          (PENDING -> RUNNING)
ldoom open       # mint a token, open the browser tab, play DOOM
ldoom suspend    # freeze the VM (compute billing stops)
ldoom resume     # thaw on the exact frame
ldoom down       # terminate the MicroVM (keeps the image so up can relaunch)
ldoom rm         # full teardown: terminate and delete the image
ldoom ps         # list capsules and their state
```
